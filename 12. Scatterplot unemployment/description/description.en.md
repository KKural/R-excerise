# Scatterplot unemployment

You have data on unemployment rates and property crime rates for 15 different cities. Create a scatterplot to visualize the potential relationship between these variables. Use the `plot()` function with appropriate labels and title.

```R
# Unemployment rates (percentage) for 15 cities
unemployment <- c(4.2, 5.7, 7.9, 6.5, 8.1, 5.3, 9.2, 7.1, 6.8, 5.9, 8.5, 7.4, 6.2, 9.0, 5.1)

# Property crime rates (per 1,000 population) for the same 15 cities
crime_rates <- c(25.3, 28.6, 33.1, 29.7, 35.4, 26.8, 38.2, 31.5, 30.9, 29.3, 36.1, 32.7, 29.0, 37.8, 27.2)

# Create a scatterplot with:
# - Unemployment rate on the x-axis
# - Property crime rate on the y-axis
# - Title: "Relationship between Unemployment and Property Crime"
# - x-axis label: "Unemployment Rate (%)"
# - y-axis label: "Property Crime Rate (per 1,000)"

# Your code here

```

**Tip:**  
Use `plot()` with unemployment as the first argument and crime_rates as the second. Use `main` for the title, and `xlab`/`ylab` for axis labels.
