You have data on offense types from police reports. Generate a frequency table that shows how many times each offense type appears in the dataset, and store the result in a variable called `offense_table`.

```R
# Vector of offense types from police reports
offense_types <- c("Theft", "Assault", "Burglary", "Vandalism", "Theft", "Theft", 
                   "Assault", "Theft", "Burglary", "Vandalism", "Theft", "Assault", 
                   "Drug Offense", "Theft", "Burglary", "Vandalism", "Assault", 
                   "Theft", "Drug Offense", "Burglary")

# Generate a frequency table of offense types and store it in a variable called 'offense_table'

# Your code here

```

**Tip:**  
Use `table()` to create a frequency table from a vector. Assign the result to `offense_table`.
