# Crime rates national average

You have crime rates per 1,000 population for five different districts, and a national average crime rate. Create a logical vector called `above_average` that indicates whether each district's crime rate is above the national average (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

```R
# Crime rates per 1,000 population for five districts
district_crime_rates <- c(5.58, 6.42, 7.05, 7.18, 6.39)

# National average crime rate per 1,000 population
national_average <- 6.2

# Create a logical vector that indicates whether each district's crime rate is above the national average
# Store the result in a variable called 'above_average'

# Your code here

```

**Tip:**
- Use comparison operators (> or >=) to compare each district's crime rate with the national average
- The result will automatically be a logical vector with TRUE/FALSE values
- Remember to assign the result to the variable `above_average`
