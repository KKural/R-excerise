# Crime rates national average

You have crime rates per 1,000 population for five different districts, and a national average crime rate. Create a logical vector called `above_average` that indicates whether each district's crime rate is above the national average (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

```R
# Use a comparison operator to compare each district's crime rate to the national average
# Assign the result to above_average
```

**Tip:**  
Use comparison operators (like `>`) to compare each district's crime rate with the national average. Assign the result to `above_average`.
