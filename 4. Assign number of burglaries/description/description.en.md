You are analyzing burglary statistics for a local police department. The data shows that there were 146 burglaries reported in the previous month.

Create a variable called `burglaries` and assign the number 146 to it.

```R
# Assign the number of burglaries to a variable named 'burglaries'

# Your code here

```

**Tip:** In R, you can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator `<-`. For example: `x <- 10` assigns the value 10 to the variable x.
