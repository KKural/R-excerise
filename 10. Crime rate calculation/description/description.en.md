# Crime rate calculation

You have data on crime counts and population for five different districts. Calculate the crime rate per 1,000 population for each district and store the results in a variable called `crime_rates`.

```R
# Use element-wise division to divide crime_counts by population, then multiply by 1000
# Assign the result to crime_rates
```

**Tip:**  
Divide crime counts by population and multiply by 1000 for rates per 1,000. Assign the result to `crime_rates`.
