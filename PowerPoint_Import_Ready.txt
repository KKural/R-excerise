**SLIDE 1: TITLE & ROADMAP**

Building Evidence-Based Dodona Learning Paths for Criminology (Sep–Dec)

Scientific Staff Position | 20-minute Presentation

Our plan today — 1-2-3:
• Challenge & approach
• Examples & tools (with screenshots)
• Plan & impact (incl. role fit & Dutch delivery)

Presenter: Dr. Kuralarasan Kumar

---

**SLIDE 2: PROBLEM → VISION**

The Challenge
• Many students start with limited quantitative background and statistical anxiety
• Abstract, non-criminology examples make concepts feel distant
• Reporting is often inconsistent and hard to reproduce

The Vision
• Domain-authentic tasks (crime rates, cross-tabs, basic regression)
• Gradual progression with support that fades
• Reproducible-by-design: outputs generated from code (tables/figures)

---

**SLIDE 3: TEACHING APPROACH**

Four Core Pillars

Bloom: Understand → Apply → Analyze → Create
PRIMM: Predict → Run → Investigate → Modify → Make
Scaffolding: Strong support at the start → Independence later
Context rules: Frequent reminders that correlation ≠ causation

---

**SLIDE 4: PLATFORM & TOOLS**

Integrated Ecosystem

Dodona: Auto-graded coding with hints and clear progression
Ufora: Quizzes, resources, announcements
GitHub: Datasets & starter code; single source of truth with tagged releases
swirl: Step-by-step console lessons

Technology Stack:
• Now: R + HTML/JS
• Next (where helpful): Python/JS widgets

---

**SLIDE 5: PORTFOLIO EVIDENCE**

What's Already Built

15 Dodona items already authored (from data basics to regression)
crimsyndata: Synthetic, privacy-safe criminology datasets
APA from code: flextable / apaTables pipeline
Metadata on each item: Bloom, PRIMM, Scaffolding

Visual Evidence:

---

**SLIDE 6: WALK-THROUGH A - CRIME RATES**

Task: Compute rate per 100,000 by district and flag above national average

Skills: group_by() → summarise() → mutate() → arrange()

Checks:
• Denominator validation
• Missing values handling
• Proper sorting

Output: APA table + 3-sentence interpretation

---

**SLIDE 7: WALK-THROUGH B - CHI-SQUARE**

Task: Offense type × Gender (association)

Steps: Contingency → Expected counts → χ² → Effect size

Challenges:
• p-value vs. effect size interpretation
• Small cell count issues

Smart Feedback: When needed, collapse categories or suggest Fisher's exact

**SLIDE 9: SEP–DEC 15 DELIVERY PLAN**

Structured Timeline

Weeks 1–2: Audit learning outcomes; item map; data dictionaries
Weeks 3–4: Sprint #1 — data literacy, descriptives, APA (6–8 items)
Weeks 5–6: Sprint #2 — dplyr, rates, joins, tidy (6–8 items)
Week 7: Visualization items (2–3) + caption standards
Week 8: Midterm mini-project template + peer rubric
Weeks 9–10: Inference (t, χ²) + regression I (4–5 items)
Week 11: Content freeze #1; add progress data hooks
Week 12: Small seminar pilot; bug-fix
Weeks 13–14: Regression II / optional spatial basics
Week 15: Content freeze #2; release candidate; Dec 15 wrap-up

---

**SPEAKING NOTES:**

Slide 1 (00:00–00:30): "Thanks for the time. I'll cover 1) the challenge and my approach, 2) examples and tools, and 3) the Sep–Dec plan and impact—then I'll close with role fit and Dutch delivery."

Slide 2 (00:30–03:00): "Students often arrive with limited quantitative background and high statistical anxiety. Abstract exercises don't feel relevant. My vision is a coherent path in Dodona: criminology-specific tasks, support that fades, and reproducible-by-design outputs."

Slide 3 (03:00–04:30): "We progress with Bloom and PRIMM, starting with strong support and moving to independence. We make the 'why' explicit, especially correlation versus causation."

Slide 4 (04:30–06:00): "Dodona powers auto-graded coding with hints; Ufora carries quizzes and resources; GitHub is the single source of truth; swirl supports console-first learners. We're R-first, adding Python/JS where it helps."

Slide 5 (06:00–07:30): "I've authored 15 Dodona items using crimsyndata—privacy-safe, realistic patterns. Outputs are APA-ready via flextable/apaTables. These screenshots show what students actually work with."

Slides 6-7 (07:30–10:30): "Crime rates: compute rates per 100k and flag above average; checks catch wrong denominators and NA issues. Chi-square: offense type × gender; we discuss small cells, effect size, and alternatives like Fisher's exact."

Slide 8 (10:30–12:30): "Here's what students see in Dodona, swirl, and crimsyndata previews. I can open a quick demo if helpful."

Slide 9 (12:30–15:00): "We run two authoring sprints, a visualization block, midterm mini-project, inference/regression modules, content freeze with pilot, then finalize and wrap on Dec 15."

Slide 10 (15:00–17:00): "I've already delivered the core pieces—Dodona items, synthetic criminology data, and APA-from-code flow—and I know our workflows. My strength is structured, evidence-based development."

Slide 11 (17:00–18:30): "I develop everything in Dutch. NT2 A2, completing A3, with a fixed review process that keeps language consistent at B1 readability."

Slide 12 (18:30–20:00): "By Dec 15, we'll hit these measurable targets. I'd value your view on Semester-2 priorities and scaling across courses. Thank you."
