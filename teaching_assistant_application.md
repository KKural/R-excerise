Dear Professors Hardyns, Vandeviver, and Pauwels,

I am writing to apply for the Teaching Assistant (ref. 202506/RE23/PA/003) position in our department. Please find enclosed a detailed document titled "Instructional Design of the R Exercise Series" that outlines my pedagogical approach and technical framework for teaching quantitative methods. As mentioned in my scientific staff application (ref. 202506/RE23/AAP/002), this teaching assistant role would complement my digital content development work, creating a synergistic combination of curriculum design and classroom implementation.

As a postdoctoral researcher in **quantitative criminology** and an advanced **R user**, I am eager to strengthen students' **data-analysis skills**, guide them through **practical coding tasks**, and assist with the evaluation of their theses and oral defences.26, 2025

Dear Professors Hardyns, Vandeviver, and Pauwels,

I am writing to apply for the Teaching Assistant (ref. 202506/RE23/PA/003) position in our department. As a postdoctoral researcher in **quantitative criminology** and an advanced **R user**, I am eager to strengthen students’ **data-analysis skills**, guide them through **practical coding tasks**, and assist with the evaluation of their theses and oral defences.

Over the past three years in the Faculty of Law and Criminology, I have focused on **spatial statistics**, **data visualization**, and **crime-data modeling**. My daily use of **R** for **reproducible analysis** and publishing in **peer-reviewed publications**, including in *Quantitative Criminology*, has shaped my academic profile. Through teaching both **UGent master’s students** and **undergraduates in India**, I have developed effective methods to **scaffold statistical concepts** and help students build confidence in quantitative analysis.

Many criminology students arrive with a limited quantitative background and often experience **statistical anxiety**. To address this, I design exercises that combine **scaffolding techniques**, **Bloom’s Taxonomy**, and the **PRIMM cycle** (Predict → Run → Investigate → Modify → Make). My classroom-ready lessons progress from worked examples to independent coding with criminology-specific tasks such as `table()`, `group_by()`, and `summarise()`. In each exercise, **contextual reminders** are provided (e.g., "Een correlatie van 0,7 tussen werkloosheid en misdaad betekent een sterk verband, maar nog geen causaal verband"), and **carefully constructed answer options** reflect and address typical student errors. Further details on these lessons are included in the supplementary document.

In addition to traditional instruction, I have developed a set of **interactive swirl lessons** specifically for criminology students. These self-paced exercises feature **embedded hints**, **contextual guidance**, and a **structured learning progression**. To ensure students can work with realistic but privacy-safe datasets, I created **crimsyndata** using the synthpop package. This **synthetic dataset** mirrors Belgian crime patterns, enabling analyses such as burglary counts by district or simulated sentencing outcomes.

Recognizing that **clear reporting** is as important as analysis, I plan to use R to help students structure their findings effectively. Tools like **apaTables** and **flextable** allow results to be formatted in **APA style** directly from code, making reporting transparent and reproducible. I intend to teach students how to **interpret test statistics** and report their results according to **academic standards**, preparing them for thesis writing and publication.

All my teaching materials are shared via **GitHub** and integrated into **Dodona** and **Ufora**, so students can work through **auto-graded, trackable exercises** with structured feedback. My familiarity with **high-performance computing environments** and large-scale or **big data applications** means I can also support departmental projects involving **big data analysis**, **spatial modelling**, or **crime-pattern detection**. My experience with **geospatial and network-based data workflows** positions me to contribute flexibly to both teaching and research activities.

This position holds strategic importance for my own professional development as I transition from research into **applied data analysis** and, ultimately, **data science**. While I bring strong skills in R, this role offers the opportunity to expand my expertise with other tools—such as **Python, SQL, and Quarto**—and apply them in an educational context. The position aligns with my broader goal of working in **applied analytics** and **educational design**, while supporting the **digital transformation** of criminology education. Together with the Scientific Staff role I have also applied for, this position would serve as a practical and pedagogical bridge, enabling me to **co-develop digital content** and reinforce it in the classroom through guidance, assessment, and adaptation based on student learning.

My understanding of **departmental workflows**—gained through teaching, internship supervision, and thesis evaluation—enables me to collaborate efficiently with course coordinators. With **NT2 A2 certification in Dutch** and ongoing **A3-level coursework**, I am also committed to creating accessible learning materials in Dutch for our students.

Attachments include:
- **Instructional Design of the R Exercise Series** - A comprehensive document detailing my pedagogical framework
- **Sample Dodona exercise** - Demonstrating practical implementation of my teaching approach
- **swirl course with installation instructions** and walkthrough video of the lesson prototype
- **GitHub link with additional resources** - Providing access to all teaching materials referenced
- **Scientific Staff application** (ref. 202506/RE23/AAP/002) - For context on how these roles would complement each other

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to supporting our students’ quantitative development and contributing to a dynamic, data-driven criminology curriculum.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Kuralarasan Kumar
