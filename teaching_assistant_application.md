**Dear Professors Hardyns, Vandeviver, and Pauwels,**

I am writing to apply for the **Teaching Assistant (ref. 202506/RE23/PA/003)** position in our department. As a postdoctoral researcher in **quantitative criminology** and an advanced **R** user, I am eager to strengthen our students’ data-analysis skills, guide them through practical coding tasks, and assist with the evaluation of their theses and oral defences.  

During the past three years in the Faculty of Law and Criminology I have specialised in **spatial statistics**, **data visualisation**, and **crime-data modelling**. Daily use of **R** for reproducible analysis and instructional design—combined with teaching both UGent master’s students and international undergraduates—has shown me how to **scaffold** statistical concepts effectively and build student confidence.

Many criminology students arrive with a limited quantitative background and often experience **statistical anxiety**. To address this, I design exercises that combine **scaffolding techniques**, **Bloom’s Taxonomy**, and the **PRIMM** cycle (Predict → Run → Investigate → Modify → Make). A sample lesson—ready for classroom use—moves from worked examples to independent coding with criminology-specific tasks (e.g. `table()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`). *(See the supplementary document for details.)*  

I also create interactive, self-paced lessons in **swirl** that include embedded hints and criminological context. A short walkthrough video of one prototype is attached to illustrate the learner experience.

To give students realistic yet privacy-safe datasets, I developed **`crimsyndata`** with `synthpop`. It mirrors Belgian crime patterns while remaining fully synthetic, enabling analyses such as burglary counts by district or simulated sentencing outcomes.  

Reporting is as important as analysis, so I teach students to produce APA-style tables with **`apaTables`** and polished reports with **`flextable`**. All materials live in organised **GitHub** repositories and integrate smoothly with **Dodona** and **Ufora** for auto-graded, trackable exercises.

I have also applied for the **Scientific Staff** post focused on developing Dodona learning paths. The two roles are complementary: as Scientific Staff I would build interactive content; as Teaching Assistant I would apply it in class, provide formative feedback, and refine materials based on student performance.

My familiarity with departmental workflows—gained through lecturing, supervising internships and theses, and collaborating with course coordinators—means I can contribute from day one. My **Dutch NT2 A2** certificate (A3 in progress) supports the creation of accessible, bilingual resources.

**In summary, I offer**

- Advanced **R** programming and reproducible-coding expertise  
- Instruction rooted in **scaffolding**, **Bloom’s Taxonomy**, and **PRIMM**  
- Proven integration of **Dodona**, **swirl**, **Ufora**, and **GitHub**  
- Targeted strategies for common student misconceptions  
- A collaborative, student-centred teaching style  

**Attachments**

1. Sample Dodona exercise (frequency tables)  
2. Annotated tidyverse + APA reporting script  
3. Walkthrough video of a **swirl** lesson prototype  
4. GitHub link with additional resources  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to helping our students master quantitative criminology through hands-on, well-scaffolded learning.

Sincerely,  
**Dr. Kuralarasan Kumar**
