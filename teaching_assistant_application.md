Dear Professors Hardyns, Vandeviver, and Pauwels,

I am writing to apply for the **Teaching Assistant (ref. 202506/RE23/PA/003)** position in our department. As a postdoctoral researcher in **quantitative criminology** and an advanced **R** user, I am eager to strengthen our students’ data-analysis skills, guide them through practical coding tasks, and assist with the evaluation of their theses and oral defences.

During the past three years in the Faculty of Law and Criminology, I have specialised in **spatial statistics**, **data visualisation**, and **crime-data modelling**. I use **R** daily for reproducible analysis and instructional design—experience that has also supported peer-reviewed publications, including in *Quantitative Criminology*. Teaching both UGent master’s students and international undergraduates has shown me how to scaffold statistical concepts effectively and build student confidence.

Many criminology students arrive with a limited quantitative background and often experience **statistical anxiety**. To address this, I design exercises that combine **scaffolding techniques**, **Bloom’s Taxonomy**, and the **PRIMM** cycle (Predict → Run → Investigate → Modify → Make). A sample lesson—ready for classroom use—moves from worked examples to independent coding with criminology-specific tasks (e.g. `table()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`). *(See the supplementary document for details.)*

I have also developed a set of interactive **swirl** lessons specifically tailored to criminology students. These self-paced exercises include embedded hints, contextual guidance, and structured progressions. A short walkthrough video is attached to demonstrate the learner experience. This format helps reinforce coding fluency while supporting diverse learning paces.

To give students realistic yet privacy-safe datasets, I developed **`crimsyndata`** using the `synthpop` package. It mirrors Belgian crime patterns while remaining fully synthetic, enabling analyses such as burglary counts by district or simulated sentencing outcomes.

Because reporting is just as important as analysis, I plan to use **R** to help students structure their findings clearly and correctly. Tools such as **apaTables** and **flextable** allow us to format results in APA style directly from code, making the reporting process more transparent and reproducible. I intend to use these tools to teach students how to interpret test statistics and report their results according to academic standards—preparing them for thesis writing and publication.

All teaching materials are organised in **GitHub** repositories and integrated with **Dodona** and **Ufora**, allowing students to complete auto-graded exercises, track their progress, and access consistent feedback.

I have also applied for the **Scientific Staff** post focused on developing Dodona learning paths. The two roles are complementary: as Scientific Staff I would build interactive content; as Teaching Assistant I would apply it in class, provide formative feedback, and refine materials based on student performance.

My familiarity with departmental workflows—gained through lecturing, supervising internships and theses, and collaborating with course coordinators—means I can contribute from day one. My **Dutch NT2 A2** certificate (A3 in progress) supports the creation of accessible, bilingual resources.

**In summary, I offer:**

- Advanced **R** programming and reproducible-coding expertise
- Instruction rooted in **scaffolding**, **Bloom’s Taxonomy**, and **PRIMM**
- Proven integration of **Dodona**, **swirl**, **Ufora**, and **GitHub**
- Experience teaching both data analysis and APA-style reporting
- A collaborative, student-centred teaching style

**Attachments:**

1. Sample Dodona exercise (frequency tables)
2. Annotated tidyverse + APA reporting script
3. Walkthrough video of a **swirl** lesson prototype
4. GitHub link with additional resources

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to helping our students master quantitative criminology through hands-on, well-scaffolded learning.

Sincerely,  
**Dr. Kuralarasan Kumar**
