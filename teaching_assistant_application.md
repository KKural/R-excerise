Dear Professors Hardyns, Vandeviver, and Pauwels,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the position of **Teaching Assistant** (ref. 202506/RE23/PA/003) within our department. As a postdoctoral researcher in criminology and an advanced R user with extensive experience in teaching and quantitative analysis, I am eager to support the implementation of R-based statistical education and contribute to the evaluation of student theses and defenses.

Over the past three years, I have taught and conducted research within the Faculty of Law and Criminology, specializing in spatial statistics, data visualization, and crime data modeling. My daily workflow is rooted in R, using tidyverse, ggplot2, sf, lavaan, and knitr to perform rigorous analyses and create reproducible, annotated code. In the classroom, I emphasize clean coding practices, reproducibility, and conceptual clarity.

I am well aware of the typical challenges students face in statistics—such as confusing descriptive with inferential statistics, misinterpreting p-values, or misunderstanding data structures like lists and factors. To address these, I use pedagogical scaffolding and Bloom’s Taxonomy: starting with well-supported examples and gradually building toward independent analysis. My exercises are structured using the PRIMM framework (Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make) and the worked → faded → independent model, so students progress from guided practice to independent mastery. Each concept is introduced with a worked example, followed by partially completed code, and finally an independent task. The series is carefully mapped to Bloom’s Taxonomy and PRIMM phases, ensuring students advance from understanding R syntax to creating their own analyses and reports. Exercises also target frequent misunderstandings through practical feedback and tips—for example, clarifying that correlation does not imply causation, or that a p-value does not measure effect size. Dutch-language tips and carefully constructed answer options further support student understanding and address typical errors. (See supplementary material for more detail.)

What distinguishes my contribution is the integration of technical functionality with sound pedagogical design. My exercises address common misconceptions through targeted feedback and practical tips. For example, correlation exercises clarify that a statistically significant relationship does not imply causation, helping students avoid interpretive errors. Dutch-language tips provide contextual reminders, while answer options reflect and address typical student errors.

As an advanced R user, I have designed multiple synthetic datasets tailored to criminological problems—such as burglary patterns across districts or simulated court outcomes. For example, I created an exercise where students use the `table()` function to generate frequency tables from simulated crime data, reinforcing both R syntax and criminological reasoning. I also show students how to report findings in APA format using packages like apaTables, sjPlot, or papaja, which generate publication-ready tables with minimal formatting burden. I am familiar with generating meaningful synthetic datasets in R using packages such as synthpop, which allow for the simulation of data that preserves key characteristics of real criminological datasets while ensuring privacy and reproducibility.

To support these exercises, I created **crimsyndata**—a synthetic, privacy-safe data package that mirrors real Belgian crime patterns without using any real individuals. This enables students to analyze and visualize results without privacy risk, while still engaging with realistic criminological relationships.

I believe in leveraging digital platforms to enhance accessibility and learning. Integrating **Dodona** with **Ufora** allows students to complete coding exercises and quizzes in an interactive, trackable environment. I maintain structured GitHub repositories with curated datasets and template R scripts aligned with course modules, giving students access to consistent materials, reusable code, and rich practice opportunities.

I have also applied for the position of **Scientific Employee**, focused on developing Dodona learning paths. These two roles are mutually reinforcing: the Scientific Employee role focuses on developing interactive, auto-graded exercises, while the Teaching Assistant role enables practical, hands-on guidance in R, formative feedback, and close involvement in thesis evaluations. Together, they ensure a pedagogically coherent and technically integrated learning environment.

My understanding of our departmental workflows comes from three years of contributing to lectures, supervising internships and theses, and supporting courses. Having already built strong working relationships with colleagues, I am well prepared to **collaborate** with course coordinators and integrate seamlessly into the team. This experience ensures I can contribute effectively from day one, with a clear understanding of the department’s culture and collaborative environment.

In summary, I offer:
- **Advanced R programming** and reproducible coding expertise
- Pedagogical experience rooted in scaffolding and Bloom’s Taxonomy
- Innovative use of platforms like Dodona, Ufora, and GitHub
- Clear strategies for tackling common student misconceptions
- A collaborative and adaptive approach to teaching and curriculum development

I am enthusiastic about contributing to our teaching team and helping students develop robust analytical and reporting skills in criminology. I am also committed to continuously improving exercises and materials based on student feedback and collaboration with colleagues.

For your reference, I have included a supplementary file containing:
- A sample Dodona exercise (R script for generating a frequency table)
- An annotated R script demonstrating tidyverse and APA reporting
- Optionally, a link to my GitHub repository with additional resources

Please let me know if you would like access to further materials.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Kuralarasan Kumar
