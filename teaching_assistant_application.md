Dr. Kuralarasan Kumar

Dear Professors Hardyns, Vandeviver, and Pauwels,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the position of **Teaching Assistant** (ref. 202506/RE23/PA/003) within our department. As a **postdoctoral researcher in criminology** in our faculty and an **advanced R user** with extensive experience in **teaching** and **quantitative analysis**, I am eager to support the implementation of **R-based statistical education** and contribute to the evaluation of student theses and defenses.

Over the past three years, I have taught and conducted research within the Faculty of Law and Criminology, specializing in **spatial statistics**, **data visualization**, and **crime data modeling**. My daily workflow is rooted in **R**, where I use **tidyverse**, **ggplot2**, **sf**, **lavaan**, and **knitr** to perform rigorous analyses and create **reproducible, annotated code**. These skills translate directly into the classroom, where I emphasize **clean coding practices**, **reproducibility**, and **conceptual clarity**.

From experience, I am well aware of the common misconceptions students encounter in statistical courses—confusing descriptive with inferential statistics, misinterpreting p-values, or misunderstanding data structures like lists, factors, and tibbles. As an educator, I address these issues using **pedagogical scaffolding** and **Bloom’s Taxonomy**: starting with well-supported examples and gradually building toward more independent application and analysis. This staged approach ensures that students move beyond rote execution toward genuine understanding and reasoning.

As an advanced R user, I have designed multiple **synthetic datasets** tailored to criminological problems—such as burglary patterns across districts or simulated court outcomes. For example, I created an exercise where students use the `table()` function to generate **frequency tables** from simulated crime data, reinforcing both **R syntax** and **criminological reasoning**. These exercises allow students to write and test their code in safe, realistic scenarios. I also help them go beyond calculation by showing how to report their findings in **APA format** using packages like **apaTables**, **sjPlot**, or **papaja**, which generate publication-ready tables with minimal formatting burden.

In addition, I have participated in the **TidyTuesday workshops** organized by NSCR for two years, where I engaged with learners from across disciplines. These sessions helped me better understand typical coding frustrations—like chaining operations with pipes or writing functions—and inform my design of exercises that are **intuitive** and **progressive in difficulty**.

Crucially, I also believe in leveraging **digital platforms** to enhance accessibility and learning. We can integrate **Dodona** with **Ufora**, allowing students to complete coding exercises and quizzes in an **interactive, trackable environment**. Students can either write R code directly in Dodona or be guided via Ufora. I maintain structured **GitHub repositories** that contain multiple curated datasets and template R scripts aligned with course modules. These can be linked directly to Ufora, giving students access to **consistent materials**, **reusable code**, and **rich practice opportunities**—all in one connected ecosystem.

I have also applied for the position of **Scientific Employee**, focused on developing Dodona learning paths. These two roles are mutually reinforcing. While the Scientific Employee role focuses on the development of **interactive, auto-graded exercises** that teach core statistical concepts, the Teaching Assistant role enables **practical, hands-on guidance** in the use of R, **formative feedback** on student work, and close involvement in thesis evaluations. Together, they ensure a **pedagogically coherent** and **technically integrated learning environment**.

I am familiar with our department’s **thesis evaluation rubrics** and **student support structures** through my prior involvement in internship and thesis supervision. I value **transparent and constructive evaluation** as a learning opportunity for students nearing graduation.

In summary, I offer a combination of:

- **Advanced R programming** and **reproducible coding expertise**
- **Pedagogical experience** rooted in scaffolding and Bloom’s Taxonomy
- **Innovative use of platforms** like Dodona, Ufora, and GitHub
- **Clear strategies** for tackling common student misconceptions
- A **collaborative and adaptive approach** to teaching and curriculum development

I am enthusiastic about contributing to our teaching team and helping students develop **robust analytical and reporting skills** in criminology. I am also committed to **continuously improving exercises and materials** based on student feedback and collaboration with colleagues.

For your reference, I have included a supplementary file containing:
- A sample **Dodona exercise** (R script for generating a frequency table)
- An **annotated R script** demonstrating tidyverse and APA reporting
- Optionally, a link to my **GitHub repository** with additional resources

Please let me know if you would like access to further materials.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,  
Dr. Kuralarasan Kumar
