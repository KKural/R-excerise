Dear Professors Hardyns, Vandeviver, and Pauwels,

I am writing to express my interest in the position of **Teaching Assistant (ref. 202506/RE23/PA/003)** within our department. With a background as a postdoctoral researcher in quantitative criminology and an advanced R user, I am eager to contribute to R-based statistics education, guide students through practical exercises, and support the evaluation of theses and oral defences.

Over the past three years at the Faculty of Law and Criminology, I have specialized in spatial statistics, data visualization, and crime data modelling. I work daily with R to conduct analyses and produce reproducible code. This technical foundation supports my pedagogical focus: helping students gain confidence and competence in statistical reasoning.

Many criminology students struggle with concepts such as p-values, measurement levels, or the distinction between descriptive and inferential statistics. To address this, I have structured a sample lesson using **Bloom’s Taxonomy** and the **PRIMM model** (Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make), which can be readily implemented in actual course settings. This structure introduces each concept through worked examples and gradually builds toward independent tasks. Exercises target common misunderstandings through scaffolded hints, Dutch-language tips, and answer options that reflect typical student errors. *(See the supplementary document for details.)*

In support of these exercises, I developed **crimsyndata**, a privacy-safe synthetic data package that mirrors Belgian crime patterns. It enables students to engage with realistic data scenarios—such as analyzing burglary patterns or simulating court outcomes—without confidentiality concerns. Using packages like **synthpop**, I generate data that retain the core characteristics of real datasets while ensuring reproducibility.

I aim to ensure that students not only perform statistical analyses but also learn to report results according to academic standards, using R pacakages such as apaTables and **`flextable`** to produce clear, publication-ready output. I have also explored integrating Dodona with Ufora, enabling interactive exercises with trackable feedback. All materials are organized through GitHub repositories with reusable scripts aligned with course modules.

I have also applied for the **Scientific Staff position** focused on Dodona-based learning paths. I see both positions as complementary: the Teaching Assistant role provides direct student engagement—offering hands-on guidance, formative feedback, and involvement in thesis evaluations—while the Scientific Staff role supports the development of structured, auto-graded exercises. Together, they enable a consistent and supportive learning experience across digital and classroom environments.

My understanding of our department’s workflows comes from contributing to lectures, supervising internships and theses, and supporting course delivery. I’ve built strong working relationships within the department, and I’m prepared to collaborate closely with course coordinators and integrate into the teaching team from day one.

In summary, I bring:
- Advanced R programming and reproducible coding  
- A pedagogical approach based on scaffolding and Bloom’s Taxonomy  
- Experience with Dodona, Ufora, and GitHub  
- Strategies to address student misconceptions  
- A collaborative, student-centered teaching style

I have included a supplementary file with:
- A sample Dodona exercise on frequency tables  
- An annotated R script demonstrating APA reporting  
- A link to my GitHub repository with additional resources

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to our teaching mission and support student learning in quantitative criminology.

Sincerely,  
**Dr. Kuralarasan Kumar**
