You have monthly offense counts for a city district over the past year. Calculate the average (mean) number of offenses per month and store it in a variable called `avg_offenses`.

```R
# Monthly offense counts for the past year
monthly_offenses <- c(42, 47, 53, 58, 61, 65, 72, 68, 59, 54, 48, 45)

# Calculate the average (mean) number of offenses and store it in a variable called 'avg_offenses'

# Your code here

```

**Tip:**
- The `mean()` function in R calculates the average of a vector of values
- Remember to assign the result to the variable `avg_offenses`
