# Filtering crime data with dplyr

You are given a small dataset of crime records. Use the `dplyr` package to filter the data and select only the rows where the crime type is "Theft". Store the result in a variable called `filtered_data`.

```R
library(dplyr)

# Use filter() from dplyr to select rows where crime_type is "Theft"
# Assign the result to filtered_data
```

**Tip:**  
Use `filter()` from the `dplyr` package to select rows based on a condition. Assign the result to `filtered_data`.
