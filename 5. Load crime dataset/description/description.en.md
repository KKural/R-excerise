You are a researcher investigating patterns of crime across different districts. You have been provided with a dataset file named "crime_data.csv" that contains records of various criminal incidents.

Load the dataset into R and store it in a variable called `crime_df`. The file path is already provided in the variable `file_path`.

```R
# Use read.csv() to load the dataset from file_path
# Assign the result to crime_df
```

**Tip:**  
Use `read.csv()` to load CSV files. Assign the result to `crime_df` using the provided `file_path`.
