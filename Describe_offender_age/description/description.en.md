# Use summary() to describe offender age

## Criminological Context
Understanding the demographic characteristics of offenders is crucial in criminological research. Age is one of the most important variables, as it can reveal patterns in criminal behavior across different life stages.

## Task
You have data on the ages of individuals who were arrested for various offenses. Use the `summary()` function to generate descriptive statistics for the offender ages and store the result in a variable called `age_summary`.

```R
# Vector of offender ages
offender_ages <- c(19, 23, 45, 32, 28, 21, 24, 19, 37, 42, 18, 25, 22, 31, 19, 
                   27, 36, 29, 24, 33, 41, 26, 20, 38, 22, 19, 25, 29, 31, 34)

# Generate a summary of offender ages and store it in a variable called 'age_summary'

# Your code here

```

**Bloom Level: Remember & Understand**

**Tips:** 
- The `summary()` function in R provides basic descriptive statistics (min, max, quartiles, mean) for numeric data
- Remember to assign the result to the variable `age_summary`
