# Load a crime dataset using read.csv()

## Criminological Context
Criminal justice researchers often work with large datasets containing crime reports, demographic information, and other relevant variables. Loading data efficiently is the first step in any analysis.

## Task
You are a researcher investigating patterns of crime across different districts. You have been provided with a dataset file named "crime_data.csv" that contains records of various criminal incidents.

Load the dataset into R and store it in a variable called `crime_df`. The file path is already provided in the variable `file_path`.

```R
# The file path is already defined
file_path <- "crime_data.csv"

# Load the dataset into a variable called 'crime_df' using read.csv()

# Your code here

```

**Bloom Level: Remember & Understand**

**Tips:** 
- Use the `read.csv()` function to load CSV files in R
- Make sure to assign the result to the variable `crime_df`
- The file path is already stored in the variable `file_path`, so you can use that directly
