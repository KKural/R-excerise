# Assign number of burglaries to a variable

## Criminological Context
In criminological research, we often work with crime statistics to analyze patterns and trends. The first step in handling such data is to assign values to variables for further analysis.

## Task
You are analyzing burglary statistics for a local police department. The data shows that there were 146 burglaries reported in the previous month.

Create a variable called `burglaries` and assign the number 146 to it.

```R
# Assign the number of burglaries to a variable named 'burglaries'

# Your code here

```

**Bloom Level: Remember & Understand**

**Tip:** In R, you can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator `<-`. For example: `x <- 10` assigns the value 10 to the variable x.
