TITLE & ROADMAP
Building Evidence-Based Dodona Learning Paths for Criminology (Sep–Dec)
Scientific Staff Position | 20-minute Presentation
Our plan today — 1-2-3:
Challenge & approach
Examples & tools (with screenshots)
Plan & impact (incl. role fit & Dutch delivery)
Presenter: Dr. Kuralarasan Kumar

PROBLEM → VISION
The Challenge
Many students start with limited quantitative background and statistical anxiety
Abstract, non-criminology examples make concepts feel distant
Reporting is often inconsistent and hard to reproduce
The Vision
Domain-authentic tasks (crime rates, cross-tabs, basic regression)
Gradual progression with support that fades
Reproducible-by-design: outputs generated from code (tables/figures)

TEACHING APPROACH
Four Core Pillars
Bloom: Understand → Apply → Analyze → Create
PRIMM: Predict → Run → Investigate → Modify → Make
Scaffolding: Strong support at the start → Independence later
Context rules: Frequent reminders that correlation ≠ causation

PLATFORM & TOOLS
Integrated Ecosystem
Dodona: Auto-graded coding with hints and clear progression
Ufora: Quizzes, resources, announcements
GitHub: Datasets & starter code; single source of truth with tagged releases
swirl: Step-by-step console lessons
Technology Stack:
Now: R + HTML/JS
Next (where helpful): Python/JS widgets

PORTFOLIO EVIDENCE
What's Already Built
15 Dodona items already authored (from data basics to regression)
crimsyndata: Synthetic, privacy-safe criminology datasets
APA from code: flextable / apaTables pipeline
Metadata on each item: Bloom, PRIMM, Scaffolding
Visual Evidence:

WALK-THROUGH A - CRIME RATES
Task: Compute rate per 100,000 by district and flag above national average
Skills: group_by() → summarise() → mutate() → arrange()
Checks:
Denominator validation
Missing values handling
Proper sorting
Output: APA table + 3-sentence interpretation
[INSERT: Code cell and APA table result screenshot]

WALK-THROUGH B - CHI-SQUARE
Task: Offense type × Gender (association)
Steps: Contingency → Expected counts → χ² → Effect size
Challenges:
p-value vs. effect size interpretation
Small cell count issues
Smart Feedback: When needed, collapse categories or suggest Fisher's exact

SEP–DEC 15 DELIVERY PLAN
Structured Timeline
Weeks 1–2: Audit learning outcomes; item map; data dictionaries
Weeks 3–4: Sprint #1 — data literacy, descriptives, APA (6–8 items)
Weeks 5–6: Sprint #2 — dplyr, rates, joins, tidy (6–8 items)
Week 7: Visualization items (2–3) + caption standards
Week 8: Midterm mini-project template + peer rubric
Weeks 9–10: Inference (t, χ²) + regression I (4–5 items)
Week 11: Content freeze #1; add progress data hooks
Week 12: Small seminar pilot; bug-fix
Weeks 13–14: Regression II / optional spatial basics
Week 15: Content freeze #2; release candidate; Dec 15 wrap-up
