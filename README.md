# Supplementary Materials for Teaching Assistant Application

This folder contains sample materials that demonstrate my approach to R-based statistical education, exercise design, and annotated analysis for criminology students. These files are intended to showcase my pedagogical strategies, technical skills, and commitment to reproducible, student-centered learning.

## Included Files

- `01-Answer.R`: Sample Dodona exercise for students, including pedagogical feedback and test cases for R variable types and factors.
- `annotated_analysis.R`: Annotated R script demonstrating tidyverse data manipulation, ggplot2 visualization, and APA-style reporting.
