**Tone:** Simple, student-friendly language; clear visuals; minimal jargon

---

## Slide 1 — Title & Roadmap (00:00–00:30)

**Building Evidence-Based Dodona Learning Paths for Criminology (Sep–Dec)**

**Our plan today — 1-2-3:**

1. **Challenge & approach**
2. **Examples & tools** (with screenshots)  
3. **Plan & impact** (incl. role fit & Dutch delivery)

**Speaker Notes:**
*"Thanks for the time. I'll cover 1) the challenge and my teaching approach, 2) concrete examples and tools, and 3) the Sep–Dec plan and impact—then I'll close with why I fit this role and how I guarantee Dutch-language quality."*

---

## Slide 2 — Problem → Vision (00:30–03:00)

**The Challenge:**
- Many students start with limited quantitative background and statistical anxiety
- Abstract, non-criminology examples make concepts feel distant
- Reporting is often inconsistent and hard to reproduce

**The Vision:**
- Domain-authentic tasks (crime rates, cross-tabs, basic regression)
- Gradual progression with support that fades
- Reproducible-by-design: outputs generated from code (tables/figures)

**Speaker Notes:**
*"Grounding every step in criminology reduces anxiety, while reproducible outputs build confidence."*

---

## Slide 3 — Teaching Approach (03:00–04:30)

**Four Core Pillars:**
- **Bloom:** Understand → Apply → Analyze → Create
- **PRIMM:** Predict → Run → Investigate → Modify → Make
- **Scaffolding:** Strong support at the start → Independence later
- **Context rules:** Frequent reminders that correlation ≠ causation

**Speaker Notes:**
*"These pillars keep cognitive load manageable and make learning feel relevant."*

---

## Slide 4 — Platform & Tools (04:30–06:00)

**Integrated Ecosystem:**
- **Dodona:** Auto-graded coding with hints and clear progression
- **Ufora:** Quizzes, resources, announcements
- **GitHub:** Datasets & starter code; single source of truth with tagged releases
- **swirl:** Step-by-step console lessons

**Technology Stack:**
- **Now:** R + HTML/JS
- **Next (where helpful):** Python/JS widgets

**Speaker Notes:**
*"This setup lets us deliver quickly, keep content tidy, and support different learning styles."*

---

## Slide 5 — Portfolio Evidence (06:00–07:30)

**What's Already Built:**
- **15 Dodona items** already authored (from data basics to regression)
- **crimsyndata:** Synthetic, privacy-safe criminology datasets
- **APA from code:** flextable / apaTables pipeline
- **Metadata** on each item: Bloom, PRIMM, Scaffolding

**Visual Evidence:**
- [Screenshot] Dodona item (prompt + hint + feedback)
- [Screenshot] APA table rendered from code

**Speaker Notes:**
*"These are the core components this role needs: authentic tasks, targeted hints, and clean reporting."*

---

## Slide 6 — Walk-Through A: Crime Rates (07:30–09:00)

**Task:** Compute rate per 100,000 by district and flag above national average

**Skills:** `group_by()` → `summarise()` → `mutate()` → `arrange()`

**Checks:** Denominator, missing values, sorting

**Output:** APA table + 3-sentence interpretation

**Visual Evidence:**
- [Screenshot] Code cell and APA table result

**Speaker Notes:**
*"This targets classic pitfalls—wrong denominators and NA handling—and finishes with clear, publishable output."*

---

## Slide 7 — Walk-Through B: Chi-Square (09:00–10:30)

**Task:** Offense type × Gender (association)

**Steps:** Contingency → Expected counts → χ² → Effect size

**Traps:** p-value vs. effect size; small cells

**Feedback:** When needed, collapse categories or suggest Fisher's exact

**Visual Evidence:**
- [Screenshot] swirl step showing prompt + immediate feedback

**Speaker Notes:**
*"Students practice correct inference language and how to adapt when assumptions are strained."*

---

## Slide 8 — Visual Gallery & (Optional) Live Demo (10:30–12:30)

**What Students Actually See:**
- **Dodona:** Prompt + hint + feedback (screenshot)
- **swirl:** Step-by-step lesson for the same topic (screenshot)
- **crimsyndata:** Small dataframe preview (e.g., head()) + variable notes (screenshot)
- **APA table:** Final formatted output (screenshot)

**Live demo (optional):** Open one Dodona item if asked

**Speaker Notes:**
*"This is exactly what students see. I'm happy to open a short example if useful."*

## Slide 10 — Role Fit & What Sets Me Apart (15:00–17:00)

**Already Delivered:**
- Dodona items • synthetic data • APA pipeline

**Domain-Authentic:**
- Criminology tasks; SPSS→R bridges; thesis-ready outputs

**Structured, Evidence-Based Development:**
- Clear specs, tests, and use of progress data to improve items

**Operational Readiness:**
- Concrete plan to Dec 15; GitHub releases; content freezes

**Department Fit:**
- 3 years in your workflows; collaborations with course leads

**Speaker Notes:**
*"I'm proposing something we can deliver now because much of it is already built and aligned with how we work."*

## Slide 11 — Dutch Delivery & Quality (17:00–18:30)

**Language Proficiency:**
- NT2 A2, currently A3 (CVO); prototype delivered in Dutch

**Review Process:**
- NL↔EN glossary • DeepL/LanguageTool • native speaker review

**Readability:**
- B1 target; student clarity polls (Dodona/Ufora)

**KPIs:**
- ≥95% items pass B1 checks; ≥4/5 clarity rating

**Speaker Notes (EN):**
*"I develop the paths in Dutch. I'm NT2 A2 and completing A3. Despite limited spoken fluency, I've already delivered a Dutch prototype. A fixed review process—glossary, automated checks, native review—keeps language clear from day one."*

**Speaker Notes (NL):**
*"Ik ontwikkel de leerlijnen in het Nederlands. Mijn niveau is NT2 A2 en ik volg A3 bij CVO. Ondanks mijn beperkte spreekvaardigheid heb ik het prototype al in het Nederlands opgeleverd. Met een vaste review-procedure (terminologielijst, automatische checks, review door een moedertaalspreker) borgen we duidelijke taal vanaf dag één."*

## Appendix — 20-Minute Speaking Script (for rehearsal)

**00:00–00:30 — Opening & roadmap**
*"Today I'll cover 1) the challenge and my approach, 2) examples and tools, and 3) the plan and impact to Dec 15—then I'll close with role fit and Dutch delivery."*

**00:30–03:00 — Problem → Vision**
*"Students often arrive with limited quantitative background and high statistical anxiety. Abstract exercises don't feel relevant. My vision is a coherent path in Dodona: criminology-specific tasks, support that fades, and reproducible-by-design outputs. Students won't just run commands—they'll interpret and report correctly."*

**03:00–04:30 — Teaching approach**
*"We progress with Bloom and PRIMM, starting with strong support and moving to independence. We make the 'why' explicit (e.g., correlation ≠ causation)."*

**04:30–06:00 — Platform & tools**
*"Dodona powers auto-graded coding with hints; Ufora carries quizzes and resources; GitHub is the single source of truth; swirl supports console-first learners. We're R-first, adding Python/JS where it helps."*

**06:00–07:30 — Portfolio evidence**
*"I've authored 15 Dodona items using crimsyndata (privacy-safe, realistic patterns). Outputs are APA-ready via flextable/apaTables. (Show Dodona and APA screenshots.)"*

**07:30–10:30 — Walk-throughs**
*"A) Crime rates: compute rates per 100k and flag above average; checks catch wrong denominators and NA issues; finish with a clean APA table. B) Chi-square: offense type × gender; we discuss small cells, effect size, and alternatives (Fisher). (Show swirl screenshot.)"*

**10:30–12:30 — Visual gallery & (optional) demo**
*"Here's what students see in Dodona, swirl, and a small crimsyndata preview. I can open a quick demo if helpful."*

**12:30–15:00 — Sep–Dec plan**
*"We run two authoring sprints (Weeks 3–6), a visualization block (Week 7), a midterm mini-project (Week 8), inference/regression (Weeks 9–10), a content freeze with progress tracking (Week 11), a small pilot (Week 12), then finalize (Weeks 13–15) and wrap on Dec 15."*

**15:00–17:00 — Role fit & what sets me apart**
*"I've already delivered the core pieces—Dodona items, synthetic criminology data, and an APA-from-code flow—and I know our workflows. My strength is a structured, evidence-based approach: clear specs, checks for common mistakes, and the use of progress data to improve."*

**17:00–18:30 — Dutch delivery & quality**
*"I develop everything in Dutch. I'm NT2 A2, completing A3, and I've already delivered a Dutch prototype. A fixed review process (glossary, automated checks, native review) keeps language consistent at B1 readability. We also run short clarity polls."*

**18:30–20:00 — Close & questions**
*"By Dec 15, targets are: ≥85% onboarding completion, −30% denominator errors, ≥70% first-pass APA tables, and ≥90% reproducibility spot-checks, plus language KPIs. I'd value your view on Semester-2 priorities and scaling across courses. Thank you."*
